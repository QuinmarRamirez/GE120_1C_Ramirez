    # Procedural Programming - Ito yung paraan ng pagpro-program kung saan ay ginagamit ang mga basics ng programming upang lumutas ng isang problema. 
        Ang programming ay hindi palaging sequential katulad ng pagco-convert ng decimal degree to degree-minute-second na kung saan ay one-way lang itong ginagawa. 
        Madalas, lalo na sa complex programming, ay gumagamit ng mga concept ng control structures. Ito ay kinapapalooban ng mga loops at boolean logic na 
        upang makuha ang nais na resulta ng problema. 

    # Functional Programming - Ito yung paraan ng pagpro-program kung saan ay gumagawa ng panibagong functions sapagkat wala sa program ng ginagamit na
        application ang nais na function. Isa pa, sa functional programming, gumagawa tayo ng panibagong functions upang iwasan ang paulit-ulit na pagcode. 
        Sa pamamagitan ng paggamit ng functions, mapaiikli natin ang pagcocode at ang pagiging complex ng isang script.

    Git is a useful application where a team can do collaboration. They can do a lot of commands through this application. They can pull and push files. 
    The Git allows the members to know when and who edited a certain file. In this way, they can effectively track and solve a problem. For instance, 
    Facebook is made of a lot of programmers. Not only one works to design, develop, debug, and maintain Facebook. It is a group collaboration. 
    Once the Facebook has a problem or it is down, the team can easily identify what needs to be resolve. Also, through Git, the outputs delivered 
    are organized since every member has their own account which they will put all their outputs.

    # While Loop - One should use this loop when the number of iterations is unknown. This is used until the desired data is achieved. In geomatics, 
        a while loop can be used in summarizing the distances and bearings of a certain lot. Users can add lines until the desired number of points 
        is delivered. Specifically, the while loop asks if the user wants to add a new point. 

    # For Loop - One should use this loop when he/she knows the number of iterations. For instance, a geodetic engineer wants to summarize the distances and bearings of a 
    certain lot, and he knows how many points does this lot have, he/she may use for loop.

     One of the main objectives of programming is to design, develop, test, debug, and maintain an application. The Divide and Conquer paradigm allows
     the programmers to split the main problem into small problems or sub-problems for them to systematically solve it. Once they have identified different problems 
     under the main problem, they can start executing it and try if that resolves the problem. 

5. 
    One of the tasks in geomatics that is being done manually is computing the latitude and departure of each line and adjust the traverse. 
    Through programming, this task can be solved easier and in a short period of time. My plan-of-attack in this task is to create a function 
    which computes the latitudes and departures, and return it. Creating such functions makes me work efficiently since I do not have to type all the necessary values
    in calculator which is prone to error - this also makes the task accurate through programming.
